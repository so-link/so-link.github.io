  abstract = {Directly deploying a trained multi-modal classifier to a new environment usually leads to poor performance due to the well-known domain shift problem. Existing multi-modal domain adaptation methods treated each modality equally and optimize the sub-models of different modalities synchronously. However, as observed in this paper, the degrees of domain shift in different modalities are usually diverse. We propose a novel Differentiated Learning framework to make use of the diversity between multiple modalities for more effective domain adaptation. Specifically, we model the classifiers of different modalities as a group of teacher/student sub-models, and a novel Prototype based Reliability Measurement is presented to estimate the reliability of the recognition results made by each sub-model on the target domain. More reliable results are then picked up as teaching materials for all sub-models in the group. Considering the diversity of different modalities, each sub-model performs the Asynchronous Curriculum Learning by choosing the teaching materials from easy to hard measured by itself. Furthermore, a reliability-aware fusion scheme is proposed to combine all optimized sub-models to support final decision. Comprehensive experiments based on three multi-modal datasets with different learning tasks have been conducted, which show the superior performance of our model while comparing with state-of-the-art multi-modal domain adaptation models.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
